# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction App

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on health metrics. It’s built using Python and designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook or deployed as a web app.

## 🚀 Features
- Logistic Regression model for binary classification
- Input fields for health parameters like glucose, BMI, age, etc.
- Displays prediction result with confidence score
- Easy-to-understand interface for non-technical users

## 📁 Files
- `Diabetes_Prediction_App.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `diabetes_model.pkl`: Trained model file
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies (optional)

## 📊 Dataset
Uses the [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which includes medical diagnostic measurements for female patients.

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajkekeli/Diabetes-Prediction-App.git

 2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab

3. Run all cells to load the model and make predictions

 Future Improvements
Add more models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)

Deploy as a Streamlit or Flask web app

Add user authentication and data logging
